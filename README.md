Ember Data Hoodie Adapter
=========================

Store your ember application data with [Hoodie](http://hood.ie)

The Code is [really simple](https://github.com/gr2m/ember-hoodie-adapter/blob/master/ember-hoodie-adapter.js).
Note that I'm new to Ember and things might be missing, but it works
for me so far.

Installation
------------

Install with [bower](http://bower.io)

```
bower install -S ember-hoodie-adapter
```
